;;; Commentary:

;; The `setup` macro simplifies repetitive configuration patterns, by
;; providing context-sensitive local macros in `setup' bodies.  These
;; macros can be mixed with regular elisp code without any issues,
;; allowing for flexible and terse configurations.  The list of local
;; macros can be extended by the user via `setup-define'.  A list of
;; currently known local macros are documented in the docstring for `setup'.

;; Examples and extended documentation can be found on Emacs wiki:
;; https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SetupEl.  Please feel free to
;; contribute your own local macros or ideas.

Wrap the macro in a `with-eval-after-load' body.

Allow macro to be automatically repeated.  If ARITY is t, use
`func-arity' to determine the minimal number of arguments.

A documentation string.

  :shorthand EXTRACTOR
If a macro defines a shorthand, it might be used as the first
argument of a `setup' form, instead of a symbol.  EXTRACTOR must
be a function of one argument.  It takes the entire macro and
returns a symbol to replace NAME.

  :debug SPEC
A edebug specification, see Info node `(elisp) Specification List'.
If not given, it is assumed nothing is evaluated.

to FN is.  If the nth parameter is not to be reinterpreted, the

functions `func'.  Any other value is invalid."
